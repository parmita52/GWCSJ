    I’m an 11th grader at Lynbrook high school and I live to learn. I'm always ready to pick up a new topic and find out everything I can about it. I want to gain as much knowledge about everything that I can and I love the feeling of knowing about something new and interesting.<br><br>

    I hope that I can really put this knowledge into use to make the world a better place. I want to solve problems and serve people.<br><br>

    Two of my passions are computer science and art. 
    I’m learning to code both at school and outside of school. At Lynbrook, I take AP Computer Science where I learn Java. Outside of school, I’m the president of my local Girls Who Code where I get to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also experiment with code on my own time. <br><br>
    I also love art. At school I’m the Public Relations Officer for ArtReach, a club that makes art for charity. I design digital promotional designs for the club. I’m also part part of the school’s Character Design Contest where I participate in weekly character design contests. 
    But mostly, I make art on my own time. I use Photoshop to create digital art, which you can see <a href="http://10-52.tumblr.com/tagged/my-art">here</a>.
